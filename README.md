# Pokemon React JS

This application displays a random match of Pokemon cards where we have two hands of Pokecards available on the screen. The system will calculate the sum of experiences of each Pokemon on the hand one and will confront with the sum of the hand two. The hand that is having the greatest level of experience summed will be considered the winner of the match. Reload the page to start a new match.
